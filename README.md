# odin-recipes

It appears that I'm doing my first pracitcal exercise with Odin by building an HTML page. Since it's title "odin-recipes", I anticipate that I'm doing something that pertains to documenting recipes. 

By the time this is done. I'm hoping that some elements (no pun intended) of HTML become second nature.

I'm adding more to this note for the sole purpose of practicing commits on git. My purpose here is to try and add the subject line and body via the command line. Hoping it works this time around.
