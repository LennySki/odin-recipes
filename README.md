# odin-recipes

It appears that I'm doing my first pracitcal exercise with Odin by building an HTML page. Since it's title "odin-recipes", I anticipate that I'm doing something that pertains to documenting recipes. 

By the time this is done. I'm hoping that some elements (no pun intended) of HTML become second nature.
